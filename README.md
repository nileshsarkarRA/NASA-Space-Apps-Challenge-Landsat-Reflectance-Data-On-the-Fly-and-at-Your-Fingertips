# NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge-Landsat-Reflectance-Data-On-the-Fly-and-at-Your-Fingertips

Develop a web-based application to facilitate the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data. The application should allow users to define a target location, receive notifications of Landsat overpasses, and access corresponding Landsat SR data.

# Key Objectives:

User-defined target location: Allow users to specify place name, latitude/longitude, or select a location on a map.
Landsat overpass notifications: Provide timely notifications about Landsat satellite passes over the defined location.
Landsat data access: Enable users to access and display Landsat SR data for the target location.
Additional features: Consider cloud cover thresholds, data acquisition options, metadata display, spectral signature visualization, and data download/sharing.

# Background:

Landsat missions provide a long-term dataset of Earth's land surface measurements.
Comparing ground-based and Landsat data can support scientific exploration, education, and data validation.
Existing applications lack a comprehensive solution for this purpose.

# Potential Considerations:

User experience: Optimize for mobile devices, ensure accessibility, and provide a user-friendly interface.
Location selection: Allow users to define target locations based on their current location or multiple pre-defined locations.
Mapping: Use a reference map to visualize the target location and Landsat scene extent.
Landsat data: Integrate with Landsat data catalogs and APIs to access and process SR data.
Notifications: Implement a system for sending notifications based on user preferences.
Data visualization: Display Landsat data in a clear and informative manner, including spectral signatures and metadata.
Data download: Allow users to download data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).
Overall, the application should empower users to explore Landsat data, compare it with ground-based observations, and gain insights into Earth's land surface.
